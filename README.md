# Witness
Monitor file system changes using Swift. Witness provides a wrapper around the [File System Events](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/FSEvents_ProgGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html) API for OS X.

## Installation

The recommended way to include Witness in your project is by using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage). Simply add this line to your `Cartfile`:

Also you can install via [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/).

## Usage

### Monitor file system events

This will trigger an event when a file in the Desktop directory is created, deleted or modified.
```swift
if let desktopPath = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(.DesktopDirectory, .UserDomainMask, true).first {
    self.witness = Witness(paths: [desktopPath], flags: .FileEvents, latency: 0.3) { events in
        print("file system events received: \(events)")
    }
}
```
